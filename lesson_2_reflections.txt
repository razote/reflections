You need to initialize a repository to make a repository
Repositories dont pop out on its own
You need to initialize it so that we can record its history

The staging area is an initial place where you put your changes
This is where you decide if the changes will be included
This is a good area where you can filter changes needed

The staging area gives you the option to see your differences
This place can diff on to your working working directory
This place can diff on to your repository
This ensures the right changes will be committed

Branches are good when there are new experimental changes
This will ensure the main repository will not be damaged
This will save a lot of time in managing files

Diagrams really help by visualizing where you are on the code
This branch structure will help people to make sure their code is safe

Merging 2 branches together combines the 2 branch
You can now delete the other branch that was merged.

It is difficult to merge manually
There might be wrong merging to happen
Hopefully there will only be automatic merging
