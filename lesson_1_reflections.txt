It is fun using command line in using diff for 2 files
I am already using a third party code diff viewer
It can do a lot of things
It can actually do highlighting which is really great

I can have a better confidence in coding with version control
If I have done some mistake that I cannot trace,
I can just revert back my codes to the working copy
Vesion control is amazing

The pros of having manual commit
You know the scope of the changes included per commit
You will have the specific changes to the specific problem

The cons of having manual commit
Large chink of code might be included in the commit
This will cause a difficulty in reading the code

I want to know more about bash scipts
I want to be proficient in this
